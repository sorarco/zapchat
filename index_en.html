        policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use
        or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

        The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are

        To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
        I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The
        reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or
        use the information for any other purpose.</p>

        content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
